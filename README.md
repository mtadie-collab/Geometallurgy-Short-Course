Welcome to the Geometallurgy in Practice short course repository. This platform provides all the necessary materials, including interactive notebooks and datasets for the short course.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `Prof L Auret/`: Materials and notebooks provided by Prof. L. Auret.
- `C Koegelenberg/`: Datasets and resources for the 3D Block Model.
- `M May/`:Spreadsheets for in class activity

## ðŸ“˜ Getting Started

**Accessing and Running Colab Notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the respective presenters folder.
   - Click on the desired file.
   - Use the "Open in Colab" badge to launch the notebook in Google Colab.
   - Ensure you're signed into your Google account.
   - Click the Colab badge to open the notebook. Save a copy to your Google Drive to begin working.
   - Run cells sequentially, following the instructions within each notebook.

## Setup

### Cloning the repository to your Google Drive
The workshop will include multiple hands-on examples, and participants will have the opportunity to get to know the various EDA tools available. We will rely on the Python programming language, implemented in [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) which requires no setup and provides access to compute resources.

To take part in the workshop, you will need to clone this GitHub repository (repo) into your own personal Google Drive.

The `clone-repo` file will guide you through the process of cloning the repo to your own Google Drive. You can open the `clone-repo` file directly by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button below. Note that this will navigate you to the Google Colab site, so you may want to open in a new tab. You will need to provide permission for the repository to be cloned to your Google Drive. If you prefer, you may simply download the repository as a zip-file and upload it to your Google Drive manually.

### Checking your setup in Google Colab
After you have cloned the repo to your Google Drive, we suggest you run the `test-setup` notebook to make sure everything is running correctly. 
1. Go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and navigate to the Geometallurgy-Short-Course folder you've just cloned.
2. Go to `/examples` and open the `test_setup` notebook
3. Make sure to edit the path in the first cell of the notebook, as explained in the instructions.
4. You should be able to run all cells in the notebook
