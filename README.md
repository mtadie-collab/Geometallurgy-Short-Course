The `clone-repo` file will guide you through the process of cloning the repo to your own Google Drive. You can open the `clone-repo` file directly by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button below. Note that this will navigate you to the Google Colab site, so you may want to open in a new tab. You will need to provide permission for the repository to be cloned to your Google Drive.
